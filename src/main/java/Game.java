     *  If word is too long or too short return 2.1, 2.2 accordingly and reduce points based on how off the word is (e.g. how many letters off)
     *
     * For either:
     *  Guess was already used, reduce points by 2 and return 4.0 (checked before 4.1 error). Guess still counts toward made guesses.
     *  Guess includes numbers/symbols etc. (so more than just letters) reduce points by 3 and return 4.1, the guess is still added to the list of guesses

     *
     * Score can also be negative, that is no problem.
     * When the player guessed 10 times and did not guess the word set the game to game over (status) and return 5.0 (no matter if there was another error).
